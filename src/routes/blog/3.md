## Running, a lot of running

For me it's been a lot. Training for a race in a couple of weeks, and I'm closing in on 150 miles since early December. Yay for me! It has been a journey. I'm looking forward to getting off my feet and back on the bike. 

Update. Race is run. 20 minutes slower than my time 11 years ago on a similar course, but 2x the elevation (3600 ft.)
