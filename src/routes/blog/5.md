## Interactive Map: Are they simply complex images?

In a previous post I asked "How can we make interactive maps that are more accessible". 

We still struggle with this at work, and arguably on the internet at large. Even the biggest players, in my view, simply punt on this. ESRI tools are allegedly comformant to per WCAG, US Section 508, and EN 301 549 standards. Or as they [https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis/mapping/mapping-the-way-to-digital-accessibility](put it) "Accessibility is an ongoing effort". 

But I can take a random example, in this case a [https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/df36d88209d9458bbd5ecf85515de827](map from the ArcGIS Experience Builder Project Gallery), and find a host of errors, _even without considering the map_:
* The big button at top right has contrast errors that fail at WCAG AA
* There is no heading structure (the main page title is a `<p>`)
* There is audio provided without transcription

Some of this is due to user configuration of the underlying tool. And sure, anyone could probably reivew my website and find issues. But I'm not a billion dollar company.
